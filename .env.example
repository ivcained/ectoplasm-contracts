# Example configuration for local/testnet scripts.
#
# Used by:
# - scripts/deploy-new.sh (reads .env from repo root)
# - scripts/test-dex.sh   (reads .env + scripts/deploy-new.out.env)
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - NODE_ADDRESS must point to the JSON-RPC endpoint.
#   Hosted endpoints often end with "/rpc".
# - You must have enough funds for the PAYMENT_* amounts.

# Testnet (example):
# NODE_ADDRESS=https://<your-testnet-rpc-host>/rpc
# CHAIN_NAME=casper-test

# Local NCTL (example):
# NODE_ADDRESS=http://127.0.0.1:11101
# CHAIN_NAME=casper-net-1

# Signing key (PEM or PKCS8 PEM)
# For NCTL, you can usually use a faucet user secret key you copied out of the container.

# Deployer account-hash (NOT a public key)
# Compute from public key:
#   casper-client account-address --public-key keys/public_key.pem
